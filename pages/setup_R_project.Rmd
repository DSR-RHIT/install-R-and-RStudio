### set up an R project 

- For the new project---for example, a new repo, an article, a workshop, a course, or a contract, whatever you wish to define as a "project"---create a new folder in your preferred directory. 

- Open RStudio. File menu > New Project > Existing Directory. Use the Browse button to find the folder you just created, then Select > Create Project. 

### test it 

- Close RStudio 

- Open RStudio. No error statements should appear (we hope). 

- If an RStudio project is open, *File > Close Project*. No errors? 

- Open an RStudio project with *File > Open Project*. No
errors?
