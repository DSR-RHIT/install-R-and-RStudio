### set up an R project

-   For the new project---for example, a new repo, an article, a workshop, a course, or a contract, whatever you wish to define as a "project"---create a new folder in your preferred directory.

-   Open RStudio. File menu &gt; New Project &gt; Existing Directory. Use the Browse button to find the folder you just created, then Select &gt; Create Project.

### test it

-   Close RStudio

-   Open RStudio. No error statements should appear (we hope).

-   If an RStudio project is open, *File &gt; Close Project*. No errors?

-   Open an RStudio project with *File &gt; Open Project*. No errors?
