### mac os

I'm not a MacOS user so I can only report to you what I have found online.

If you follow the instructions linked below and encounter problems, you might try asking Michael Galarnyk, the blog author, for help.

[Install R and RStudio on Mac](https://medium.com/@GalarnykMichael/install-r-and-rstudio-on-mac-e911606ce4f4)

### shortcuts on the desktop

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, so I rarely run R directly. For this reason, I suggest

-   Put a shortcut to RStudio on the desktop

-   Delete the shortcuts to R (if any) on your desktop

### when the installation is complete

First, [create top level package library](setup_Renviron.md)

Second, [set up an R project](setup_R_project.md)
