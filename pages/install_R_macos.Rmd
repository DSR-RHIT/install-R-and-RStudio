### mac OS  

This link was recommended by a trustworthy source. I'm told that the trick to the Mac OS installation is to folllow the instructions carefully and to make sure you match your specific OS version exactly.

We haven't developed our own, student-tested guidelines for the Mac OS. Anyone who is successful and would like to contribute instructions, please let us know. (layton@rose-hulman.edu)

-   Delete the shortcuts to R (if any) on your desktop
