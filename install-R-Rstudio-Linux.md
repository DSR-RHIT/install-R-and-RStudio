This is a simplified procedure for installing R and R-studio on Ubuntu 16.04 without the use of the commandline.
* Use Ubuntu Software Center to install Synaptic Package Manager (requires root previlage). 
* Open Synaptic Package Manager and search for r-base.
* Click on r-base and select Mark for Installation.
* Click on Apply. (R and its dependencies should be installed.)
* I found you also need to install libcurl3 package. Search and install libcurl3 using Synaptic Package Manager.
* Download RStudio by going to [R Studio Download Page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/) and selecting 0.99.903 - Ubuntu 12.04+/Debian 8+ (64-bit)
* Right click the downloaded file for RStudio and select Open With Software Install. Then select install.
